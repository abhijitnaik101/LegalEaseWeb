                <p>Please note that criminal laws in India are primarily codified in various statutes and codes, such as the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), rather than being explicitly outlined in the Constitution. The Constitution provides the framework for the legal system and safeguards the fundamental rights of individuals, which are relevant to criminal proceedings and justice.</p>
