            <h1>The Indian Constitution does not have specific articles that are explicitly titled or dedicated to "domestic laws." Instead, the Constitution provides a framework for the governance of India and the legal system. It lays down the basic structure of the government, the fundamental rights and duties of citizens, and the principles that guide the functioning of the state. Domestic laws in India are enacted separately through various statutes, codes, and acts. However, there are several articles in the Constitution that are relevant to the functioning of domestic laws and the legal system. Here are some key articles:</h1>

<h2>Article 13:</h2>
<p>Laws inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights - This article states that any law that is inconsistent with or in derogation of fundamental rights shall be void.</p>

<h2>Article 32:</h2>
<p>Remedies for enforcement of rights - Article 32 provides individuals with the right to move the Supreme Court for the enforcement of their fundamental rights.</p>

<h2>Article 226:</h2>
<p>Power of High Courts to issue certain writs - Similar to Article 32, this article empowers High Courts to issue writs for the enforcement of rights, including challenging the validity of domestic laws.</p>

<h2>Article 245:</h2>
<p>Extent of laws made by Parliament and by the Legislatures of States - This article defines the territorial jurisdiction of laws made by Parliament and state legislatures.</p>

<h2>Article 246:</h2>
<p>Subject-matter of laws made by Parliament and by the Legislatures of States - This article delineates the subjects on which Parliament and state legislatures can make laws.</p>

<h2>Article 265:</h2>
<p>Taxes not to be levied or collected except by authority of law - This article emphasizes that no tax or penalty can be imposed or collected except under the authority of law.</p>

<h2>Article 368:</h2>
<p>Power of Parliament to amend the Constitution - While primarily related to constitutional amendments, this article is relevant to any changes in the domestic legal framework, including amendments to existing laws.</p>

<h2>Article 372:</h2>
<p> Continuation in force of existing laws and their adaptation - This article deals with the continuity and adaptation of existing laws after the adoption of the Constitution.</p>

<h2>Article 372(A):</h2>
<p>Power of the President to adapt laws - This article empowers the President to make adaptations of existing laws to bring them in line with the provisions of the Constitution.</p>

<h2>Article 375:</h2>
<p>Courts subordinated to the Supreme Court - This article defines the hierarchy of courts and their jurisdiction in matters of domestic laws.</p>

<p>It's important to note that while the Constitution provides the framework and principles for the legal system in India, detailed domestic laws, including criminal laws, civil laws, labor laws, tax laws, and various other laws, are enacted separately through legislation by the Indian Parliament and state legislatures. These laws address specific aspects of governance, rights, and obligations in the country.</p>
